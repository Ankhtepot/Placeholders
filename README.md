# Placeholders

This is an Angular project that demonstrates rather basic page for non-existent metal band Placeholders. 
This project began as a job from a client which was later scratched, but I decided to keep working on it and use it as a part of my portfolio.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## deploy on GitHub Pages

```bash
ng deploy placeholders
```
